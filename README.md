# R.O.S-Rubik-Operating-System

The Future Of Computer Operating Systems, The OS Of The Century



1|| I have always admired the experience of Linus Torvalds father of "#LINUX OS", at the same time I always looked with some amazement at the experience of Microsoft - MSX



2|| How to create an "Operating System" that sits on top of all "OS" without dispute



3|| If you liked the description, I would say:
It is the "Absolute System" that "Obsolete" the others, and the #NATURAL alternative to all "Computer Operating Programs" in today's world



4|| In Microsoft Windows you can run a Playstation game through programs known as "Emulators". And "Emulator" is a nice simple word saves you from using the term "Virtual Machines"



5|| This was impossible until recently where the right conditions were prepared with:

- "Quantum PC" or #QPC, which will replace the #PC soon



- And a very simple #IDEA that I see it personally has a very big future if it is used well and exploited intelligently, this idea you can find in "Linux - Bottles"



6|| The GOAL is that humanity and the world do not fall into a situation similar to "Pre-MSX" era



7|| I propose #ROS: "Rubik OS" to be the only "Global System" for all the "OS" and platforms for the "Quantum Computers" in particular
[You can call it: U.O.S The Universal Or The Unified 'Ultimate-Undisputed' Operating System (really, anything you like)]



8|| The advantages of "R.O.S" that distinguish it from all current operating systems, are many but here are some:


- "R.O.S" is engineered to work specifically with #QC

- Due to the high value of "R.O.S", it can't be run with any "POTATO PC", and it can't be run with any Lowend PC

- If "R.O.S" is used with the current "Personal Computers", the PC must be of very high quality

- "R.O.S" is primarily based on high-quality Hardware Installation

- "R.O.S" is an environment that includes several systems widely used "pre-installed" in it

- We call these systems instead of "Virtual Machine" a "BOX"

- The installed programs are placed in "Bottles", each program, regardless of its size and extension, is placed in its own "Bottle"



[In short, an environment "R.O.S" that includes several environments "Win, Linux, Android...etc", and each environment "The BOX" contains "Bottles" and each "Bottle" contains a #SOFTWARE that you use]



- Imagine:

"RETROARCH" as an "OS" for your PC not an "Emulator"
(don't think to much about the word "emulators" am using it to simplified the IDEA to you for a better explanation
think about your OS that you are using now, OK, can you run other softwares not mant for your OS, OK. How do you do that!?)

You don't need "Windows" to run it, you don't need "Linux", you don't need BlueStacks or any of Google's environments or anything else for ever

"Different Platforms But One Environment On One Screen"

[For the idiots:

Imagine playing an "Android game", while you capture the screen with a "Windows program" and then process "Edit" everything with an "IOS app" and upload this to the web via a special "Web Browser" lets say a Firefox "LINUX ver"

All this via your computer screen without closing anything]

9|| What does this mean in our current world in short:

"It is the end of the motherboard, Intel processors and NVIDIA GPU as we know them and know the industry associated with them


Do you think this is achievable, and who wants to participate.!?
